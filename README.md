# Todo List Manager

This is a responsive web application built with React.js (or Next.js) for managing your to-do list. It allows users to:

- **View Tasks:** See a list of existing tasks with their title, description, and completion status on the Home Page.
- **Create Tasks:** Add new tasks with titles and descriptions on the Add Task Page.
- **Update Tasks:** Mark tasks as completed or incomplete on the Home Page.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
    - React.js (or Next.js) for building the user interface.
- **State Management:**
    - Redux Toolkit (or Context API) for managing application state.
- **API:**
    - Uses REST API calls to a dummy API (jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos) for fetching and updating task data.
- **Styling:**
    - You can choose to use a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS, Material UI, or style it with plain CSS. (Not included in this project by default)
